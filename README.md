I am an educational professional with around 8 years of experience teaching a variety of courses like Natural Language Processing, Parallel Programming using CUDA, Information Retrieval, Object Oriented Analysis and Design, and C++ programming. I have also been a freelance content writer with articles on bug fixes and solutions for Windows 10/11 errors. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Generative AI to upgrade my skills to match the job market.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with "How to fill the career gap and get back to work?"
